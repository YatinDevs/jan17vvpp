      "The Foundational Stage focuses on holistic growth across physical, cognitive, socio-emotional, ethical, language, and cultural development. Learning is centred on play-based experiences using concrete materials such as toys, puzzles, picture books, and children’s literature. Strong emphasis is placed on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy. Students learn two languages and achieve literacy in R1 by the end of this stage. Teaching fosters warm, nurturing relationships with a balance between individual exploration and group activities. Assessment is observation-based, with worksheets only in Grades 1 and 2 and no formal examinations.",
